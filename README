Creating picture albums from mails. 

This project aims to give an overview of all those images, you might have floating around in your mail. 

The idea is to connect Gmail to Picasa via Google App Engine, so that all traffic is kept on Google's servers. 
Unfortunately, I haven't yet found a way for GAE to access Gmail directly (IMAP is not allowed, for instance).
